\usage{
overlapPos(comp, ref, mapping = "probeset", snp6.dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{comp}{Input comparison data with a $Probe_Set_ID column}

\item{ref}{Reference probeset order where rownames are Probe_Set_IDs}

\item{mapping}{If "probeset", will using $Probe_Set_ID from comp dataframe.}

\item{snp6.dat}{SNP6 probeset genomic position, accessible from CCLid::ccl_table
Else, it will use the rownames of ref as the probe set IDs}
}
\description{
parent function that handles how overlaps are done between COMParing 
group and REFerence datasets
