Description: This package has 3 main functions that all centre on analyzing the
  genotypes of cancer cell lines and compares them against 1,497 unique cancer cell
  lines analyzed across 3 large pharmacogenomic datasets. The 3 functions are to
  1) identify an input cell line VCF using the genotype and B-allele fraction (BAF) as the 
  input for a logistic regression, 2) identify regions of the genome that are drifted
  by scanning for segments where the BAF are significantly different from a comparator
  cell line, and 3) run a deconvolution on the cell line BAFs using NMF to identify 
  if two or more cell lines are mixed and to what proportion they are.
